Translation of Dante's Divine Comedy (in Portuguese) at stelle.com.br (1998-2000)

This is a repository of the static content at www.stelle.com.br which contains a translation of Inferno and Purgatory from italian verse to Portuguese prose.
The website was created in 1998 and updated in 2000. Most of the server side apps no longer work, but the client-side JavaScript and CSS are still working. The only parts of the site that need updating are the server-side apps to make it 100% usable. Of course the design and usability also needs some updating to Web 2.0 / responsive / mobile standards.
