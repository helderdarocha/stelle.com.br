<p>Hi! I am Helder da Rocha. I was born in Campina Grande, Brazil, lived in Canadá (Kitchener-Waterloo) for 5 years, spent another 15 in Campina Grande and now I live in São Paulo, since 1995. Here I author books, courses, speeches and classes about the Web, the Internet, Java, XML and other "technical" stuff. Occasionaly, I escape to the jungles, beaches and mountains. Other times I stay and enjoy life in the metropolis, its people, arts and places. I also enjoy reading, writing, speculating and discussing other "non-technical" subjects. 

<p>Formally, I am an electrical engineer with a M.Sc. degree in computer science. I am also a Sun Java Certified Programmer. My main economic activity is to author and prepare courses about programming, the Web and emerging related technologies. I also develop software and teach frequently. I love teaching, writing and speaking at conferences. I've written books about Web technologies and organized conferences about Java. If you want to know more about these subjects, check my <a href="http://www.argonavis.com.br/curriculum2001e.txt">résumé</a>.  

<p>Despite my "technical" background, my interests in other fields of knowledge are not usually treated merely as "hobbies". I eventually approach some interesting topic in art, philosophy, science, politics (specially citizenship and environmental preservation) and go as far as I can into the details. I am really an art guy disguised as a technologiccal geek. If I could I would only write, make music, act, and explore the arts and sciences. My latest interests include literature, music,  painting, photography and astronomy. My most recent "big" project is online, which is an adaptation os Dante's <a href="http://www.stelle.com.br/" target="_top">Divine Comedy</a> (in portuguese).
 
<P>I have a serious love-hate relationship with e-mail. Sometimes, hundreds of messages acumulate and Chaos takes control. I'm trying to learn how to deal with e-mail and escape from all the entropy it generates, which gobbles up all the time I have. I love receiving e-mail and I read all e-mails I receive (except, obviously, spam), but I don't always have the time to reply to all that I wish I could. But don't give up. Send me an e-mail! I might reply! Use <b>helder dot darocha at gmail dot com</b>.</P>
