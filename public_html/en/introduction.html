<H1>Introdu&ccedil;&atilde;o</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="e_y.gif" WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60 ALT="E"> This site contains an adaptation of the epic poem called Hell (Inferno) by the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). Hell is the first of the three long poems that complete the Comedy (later Divine Comedy) – Dante’s masterpiece, that was written between 1307 and 1321, in Italian. The Comedy is a Christian allegory which describes, in rhymed verses, a journey through Hell, Purgatory and Paradise. It is divided in 100 chapters which are called <I>Cantos</I>. The first 34 <I>Cantos</I> narrate the voyage through Hell. </P>
<P>If you moved around this site you should have noted that it is still under construction. I hope to finish the section dedicated to Hell before May. Hopefully, by August, the whole site will be complete.</P>
<P>Use the frame on your left to move around in this site. Its look and its links may change depending on the options you select in order to make navigation in each section easier. Extra menus can be found on top and on the bottom of each page. If you decide to read this e-book on-line, you may use our e-bookmark to keep track of the place where you stopped reading. If you have any problems accessing information in this site, if you encounter errors or if you would like to make any comments please contact me via e-mail at: <i>helder dot darocha at gmail dot com</i></P>
<P>Before you start your journey into the underworld, read an introduction about the <I>Divine Comedy</I> and learn something about the life of its author, Dante Alighieri. If you’re in a hurry to go to Hell, then start by getting lost in the Dark Wood. It’s where your trip begins.</P>
<P>This version is a translation of an adaptation I wrote in Portuguese. To compile the Portuguese version I used several sources, including two translations of the Comedy in English and two translations in Portuguese, besides the Italian original. These sources (and many others which I used to write the comments) are listed in the <I>References</I> page.</P>
