<h1>Play On!</h1>

<p>Hi! This is a preliminary version of a simple database application
which will allow you to keep in touch with other <a href="http://www.playoff06.de" target=flickr>Play-off'06</a> participants.
<p>If any information in your profile is wrong (Name, e-mail, country), or
if you want to change something, or if you know of someone who is missing, 
please email me so I can fix it (I'm still fixing bugs and adding features).

<h3>Other news: Photos</h3>
<p>I have set up a group in <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target=flickr>Flickr</a> so we can
share photos and participate in discussions. The link is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/playoff06/" target=flickr>Flickr Play-off'06 group</a>.
After you upload your photos, use the Flickr menu to add the ones you wish to the group.
<p>Benjamin Stöß, photographer at Play-off in Gelsenkirchen, has also set up a site with photos and you can also fill in a profile there and upload your photos.
The link is <a href="http://playoff06.yeeeha.net/" target=yeeha>Yeeha Play-off/06</a>.
